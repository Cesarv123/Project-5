<div class="about">
<p>Hello everyone! nice day today. i want to share to you a little bit about me here are some things i want you to know
            im 21, i have been with amazon for about 2 and a half almost 3 years now. About a year ago, i discovered coding from one of my friends.
            he is a software developer and enjoys his job. long story short, i found out it was a stay at home job, and makes a great amount of money 
            that lets him support his family.honestly im a big family guy(no pun intended).i love being in the house hanging out going to the movies 
            hitting the parks(water parks as well). there is nothing i wont do with my family. another thing i want you to know about me is i love the 
            sport of boxing.
</p>
<br>
<p> lets get back to coding. the reason i want to code is because there are many jobs in that field which makes it a pribability to get a job in
            field which of course comes with a bigger salary. I mean we are adults, who doesnt want a better source of income am i right? anyway im a stower at amazon and 
            what i do is i place customer orders into pods which then get sent to a receivin g team where they pick your items which then get sent to a department where they
             place the order in to a box. i have a love and hate relationship with my job. its cool but gets boring sometimes. i love the people that work beside me though. 
             especially the management team. where i work it gets overwhelming at times but the management team as well as the safety team is there to help and support you to make sure 
             you are okay.
